# StepUpBlocks
StepUpBlocks is a configurable Fabric Minecraft mod that lets you step up full blocks like stairs or slabs.\
It does so by increasing a player's pehkui:step_height attribute to stay compatible with other mods.\
(Of course, if pehkui:step_height is already high enough to climb up a block, the mod does not lower it back to 1 block)

### Installation
Requires Minecraft 1.20.1, [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/) >=0.14.25, [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api), [Pehkui](https://github.com/Virtuoel/Pehkui) and [Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config).

### Configuration
The mod can be configured from within the file ".minecraft/config/stepupblocks.json5" or using modmenu.
