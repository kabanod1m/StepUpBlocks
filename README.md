# StepUpBlocks
StepUpBlocks is a configurable Fabric Minecraft mod that lets you step up full blocks like stairs or slabs.\
It does so by increasing a player's stepHeight value.\
(Of course, if stepHeight is already higher than specified via config, the mod does not lower it)

### Installation
Requires Minecraft 1.20.1, [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/) >=0.14.25, [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api), [Pehkui](https://github.com/Virtuoel/Pehkui) and [Cloth Config API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config).

### Configuration
The mod can be configured from within the file ".minecraft/config/stepupblocks.json5" or using modmenu.\
This mod can be configured to:\
* Not allow stepping up a block while sneaking
* Not allow stepping up a block while "swimming" (or just being forced into swimming)
* Not allow stepping up a block if a special, configurable key, is not currently held
* You can disable the mod in-game
* You can specify the maximum step height
